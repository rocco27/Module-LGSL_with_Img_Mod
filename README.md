This module is a compilation of software from www.greycube.com,
LGSL 5.8 Beta 21 By Richard Perry & Image Mod By CGX24, that I found on their forums.
I created some files, so it can be installed as a module for OGP, if the LGSL feed is active,
and you use your own feed from this module. The servers running from your OGP Panel
will be added atomatically to the live game server list, then can be shown externally to
the Panel, also you can use the banner generator to add banners with the status of your servers.

Also you can add game server from others to your game server list to monitorize them.
